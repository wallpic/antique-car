I wanted to share some valuable information about antique vehicles registered with Antique Vehicle tags in North Carolina. Some states say a car must be at least 20 years old to be considered a classic while others. If the car is manufactured in 1980 or later it is considered a collector car.

Typically by state law a car or truck that is over 40 years old is considered to be an antique.

Car owners can successfully obtain a North Carolina vintage vehicle registration as well as register a custom car only if their motor vehicles meet the corresponding vehicle definition under the applicable state regulations.</p>
