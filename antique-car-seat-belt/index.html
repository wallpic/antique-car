We like to go for drives in our late 1960s convertible with a full backseat. All belts meet FMVSS laws. Force was great enough at 5 MPH for me to always have seat belts in all my cars. The car rolled down a ramp at 5 MPH and hit a stop.</p>

<p>Red Wagon Station Wagon Wagons Nostalgia Made in the USA. Lap belts also available in 30 colors and 5 buckle options. Belt Safety Some hobbyists like that they can drive vintage cars and trucks without seat belts. If a cop tickets you for no seat belt in an antique go to court with data on when the belts were federally required and the inspection rules that dont require them for the car bring photos of the car showing it passed inspection too - if you want to be a real PITA about it challenge it so the cop has to come to court and get educated too. Section 10 provides an exemption for drivers and passengers from wearing a seat belt if a motor vehicle was manufactured without seat belt assemblies for each seating position and the vehicle.</p>

<p>1956 Classic Car Ad 56 New Ford Victoria V 8 Little Bear Cartoon 011918 Ebay Classic Cars Little Bear Cartoon Classic Car Photoshoot I have a 1939 Packard which of course has no seat belts. Section 10 provides an exemption for drivers and passengers from wearing a seat belt if a motor vehicle was manufactured without seat belt assemblies for each seating position and the vehicle. Obviously there are no tether options in this car as it is only lap belts all around. 55 ears ago I rode in a small car in a test of seat belts at my Air Force Base. We have several antique vehicles pre-1968 that are not equipped with seatbelts.</p>
