<p>Pin By Riemer On Volksrods All Over The World Rat Rod Volkswagen Wheels And Tires On average people drive between 12000 to 15000 miles a year which means the average good quality all-season tire will last somewhere between three and five years depending on maintenance driving style and conditions. The best method to use tires is to rotate the tires after every 8000-10000km front right - front left - rear left - rear right so that they wear out evenly. As a general rule the original tires on a new vehicle or quality replacement tires should last up to 50000 miles. However tires manufactured before the year 2000 have a 10-character code. You can find the original date of manufacture of the tire on the sidewall.</p>

<p>Model A Ford Wouldn T Change A Thing Except Matching The Front Tires Antique Cars Cool Trucks Rat Rods Truck There is no exact answer to how long a particular tire will last but there are things a driver can do to get the most out of their tire investment and avoid driving on unsafe tires. On average people drive between 12000 to 15000 miles a year which means the average good quality all-season tire will last somewhere between three and five years depending on maintenance driving style and conditions. There is a simple logic in this the older the tire is the harder the rubber gets basically old tire wont wear a lot so unused old tyre could be good but only on dry road I am speaking of 5 year tire maximum for example driving 7-11 year tire on wet road is suicide cheap new tire has better qualities than 5 year contipirelli new tire can endure up to 50000km when driving very gently. Current guidance suggests that tires should be expected to last a maximum of only six years. And to my way of thinking cutting you tires cost in half is pretty good compensation for a slightly rougher ride.</p>

<p>Pin On Ancient Cars 1900 1949 Answer 1 of 21. While bias-ply cords run diagonally between beads in a radial tire theyre at 90 angles. Answer 1 of 5. Notations are made on the condition of the scrapped tire the number and type of repairs on the tire the number of times the tire has been retreaded and the overall age of the tire casing. There is a general consensus that most tires should be inspected if not replaced at about six years.</p>
