The Classic Car Club of America has a strict list of acceptable cars that were produced between 1925 and 1948. 1 Organizations such as the Classic Car Club of America CCCA maintain lists of eligible unmodified cars that are called classic. However some states consider anything made after the end of the Forties a Classic. Generally speaking antique cars are 45 years or older while classic cars are 20 years or older.</p>

<p>Pin On Veterans To The Year 1920 A classic car is an older car typically 20 years or older though definitions vary. States may also have their own rules to define. To someone like me thats not very significant since I typically keep my vehicles for 30 years or more. Typically by state law a car or truck that is over 40 years old is considered to be an antique. There is no universally accepted standard as to what makes a car a classic.</p>

<p>1905 Spyker Sv Old Classic Cars Antique Cars Vintage Cars In many states an antique car is one that is 20 or 25 years old. A more precise classification is one which sets up three categories according to which year the cars were manufactured. Certain states have specific designations for antique vehicles deeming them historic as opposed to comparatively newer classic cars. As of 2014 many states vehicle registries consider an antique car one that was built after 1922 and is at least 20 years old. States may also have their own rules to define.</p>

<p>Gallery Home Supercars Net Coupe Cars Vintage Cars Antique Cars There are those who believe that a car becomes an antique at 15 20 or 25 years. Vintage cars made between 1916 to 1924 and was the start of the real automobiles and classic cars from 1925 up. Generally cars that are considered Vintage were manufactured between the years of 1919 and 1930 but some end it. What constitutes a vintage car depends on whos defining it but as a rule of thumb its a car that was built before 1930 1925 by some definitions so its a car from the very early days of motoringexcept anything that has been modified into something like a hot rod. But as with many subjects in the motoring world not everyone can agree on a single definition.</p>
