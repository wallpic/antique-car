These were one of my favorite rides to do as a kid at Kings Island back in the day. Prior to being removed from the park the antique car ride previously called Les Taxis operated for 32. Also something similar t. Antique cars returning to Kings Island in 2019.</p>

<p>Kings Island The Rotor 1972 1981 Kings Island Cincinnati Kings Island Riviera Hotel Las Vegas Still hoping they work on Racer this off-season. Back in August 2018 it was announced the Kings Mills Antique Autos are returning to Kings Island in 2019. The cars are 23 scale replicas of the 1911 Ford Model T. Still hoping they work on Racer this off-season. I didnt go on every trip but went on more than I care.</p>

Discover and save your own Pins on Pinterest. Though new the Kings Mills Antique Autos will retain the vintage feel of the original antique cars which operated at Kings Island from 1972 to 2004 and gave over 225 million rides. Kings Mills Antique Autos is the name and a grand return is their game. A little rainy on preview night for Gold Pass members but still a lot of fun.</p>
