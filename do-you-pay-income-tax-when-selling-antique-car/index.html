<p>Produced From 1968 Through To 1992 Is The Iconic Daimler Ds420 Salvage Cars Austin Cars Automotive Design I dont know how IN treats capital. In other words is it treated as income. If you sold the car for more than the total cost calculated in steps 1-3 then youll owe tax on that amount. Selling your own car is not considered a capital as it is a personal asset. When you are the seller of the car are you required to pay tax on the money you receive for the sale.</p>

<p>Investing In Collectible Cars Top Tips And Risks If you sell the car for less than what you bought it for its a personal loss which is not deductible for income tax purposes. By definition Capital Gains Tax CGT is a tax on the profit that you make when you sell or dispose of an asset that has increased in value. If you owned it for less than a year it goes at your current income tax rate for your salary but collectibles are capped at 28 capital gains tax even if your income bracket has a higher tax rate. The answer to this question is no you do not have to pay taxes on the sale of your vehicle unless of course you actually sell your car for more than what its worth or more than the vehicles original purchase price. You will pay it to your states DMV when you register the vehicle.</p>

<p>Guide To Classic Car Insurance Forbes Advisor However if you sell it for a profit higher than the original purchase price or what is called a capital gain you must report the windfall on your income tax return and pay taxes on it. It depends on your situation. However tangible property held for investment purposes including antiques qualifies for tax. Determine the original purchase price. I think its silly if it is as you would technically have paid tax twice on the same thing.</p>
