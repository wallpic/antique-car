<p>1938 Mg Va Tourer Chassis No Va 1514 Engine No Tpbga21594 Antique Cars British Cars Roadsters Buyers in the know understand that an antique is something quite specific and not just anything old A seller who calls something made in the 1950s antique for example is just plain wrongA seller who uses the term antique when an item is much too new for that designation should raise questions in your mind. Antique license plates are provided by DMV while vintage license plates are original Virginia license plates issued prior to 1976 that you provide. Antique vehicles are at least 25 years old as well however they may only be used for recreational transportation purposes testing repairs and maintenance as well as participation in tours exhibits parades and other related activities. And some classifications overlap between classics and antiques. Or just the fact that its older than 25 years im good.</p>

<p>Norfolk Va Police Car Early 1900s Oh How Far We Ve Come In 100 Years Police Cars Old Police Cars Police Defining the Term Antique. As we mentioned above the Antique Auto Club of America says antique cars are those that are 25 years old or older. However some states consider anything made after the end of the Forties a Classic and anything from 1949 back to be an Antique. Note that car owners who obtain a historic vehicle registration and antique tags can only use their vehicles for participation in educational events such as tours exhibits and car parades. At the state level permanent antique plates are provided at a one time charge of 50 and if you wish to obtain and use actual original plates of the cars year of manufacture that can be done for the same fee.</p>

As examples this age is 20 years in the US. Antique vehicles must be insured with motor vehicle liability insurance or you must pay the uninsured motor vehicle fee. A vehicle is classed as a vintageveteran once its 30 years old from date of manufacture and a concessionary rate of motor tax applies See List of Motor Tax Rates. These vehicles must also be considered a collectors item.</p>
