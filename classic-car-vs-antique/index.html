Classic cars are generally held to be vehicles of very special interest made between 1920 and the late 1970s. Understanding what defines an antique or vintage car helps you understand what classic means to a collector.

<p>Old School Cars Porter Vs Reo Most Valuable Classic Cars Antique Cars Old School Cars Old Classic Cars In general a car has to have some mark of distinction and to have been produced in very small numbers making it rare today. The vehicle must be in the good original condition meaning it was like that it is like when it left the factory. Veteran generally means a car made up to and including December 1918 but. Price alone isnt a criterion for determining a classic vs. In simple terms veteran cars are the oldest.</p>
