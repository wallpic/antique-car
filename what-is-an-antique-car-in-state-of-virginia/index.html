<p>Old Pictures Of West Virginia State Police Area Law Enforcement Mackey S Antique Clock Repair West Virginia History West Virginia State Police Virginia is very antique car friendly toward cars at least 25 years old that are agreed upon to be subject to limited use restrictions. For example a plate that was issued in 1927 can only be used on a 1927 model vehicle. Part of the West Virginia antique vehicle registration procedure is identifying whether your vehicle classifies as an antique ride or a classic car. At the state level permanent antique plates are provided at a one time charge of 50 and if you wish to obtain and use actual original plates of the cars year of manufacture that can be done for the same fee. On receipt of an application and evidence that the applicant owns or has regular use of another passenger car autocycle or motorcycle the Commissioner may authorize for use on antique motor vehicles and antique trailers Virginia license plates manufactured prior to 1976 and designed for use without decals if such license plates are embossed with or are of the same year of issue as the model year of the antique motor vehicle or antique trailer.</p>
