It is possible if you actually use old parts like a 1965 engine or complete 60s frame and power train that the vehicle will be registered as that model year replica but that is determined by Texas DMV. Once youve determined the car is old enough to fit the criteria in your state youll need to carefully review what restrictions come with the plates. Instead of Classic License Plates the owner of a classic vehicle may useembossed license plates issued by this state that is the same year as themodel year of the vehicle. This car needs to have a traditional registration to prove to the state that you have another source of transportation that will take care of your daily driving needs.</p>

If youre planning on having a classic car registered with antique plates youll need to prove to the DMV that you have another car as your daily driver. A current valid inspection sticker is not required on your vehicle if it is registered as an Antique vehicle. If you have a pair of license plates that match and the numbers on them do not conflict with some other vehicle using those numbers In Calif we had some refusals because some motorcycle plate numbers were the same as some old plates you can take those and your vehicle to your local motor vehicle dept. Here in Texas you can run antique or YOM plates as long as vehicle is registered as an antique.</p>
