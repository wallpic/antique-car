Usually the classic car moniker applies to vehicles over 20 years old. For a car to be considered a classic it must be more than 20 years old in good condition and true to the original design. Of course this is just a ballpark and your project could cost more or less depending on the car. Most states define an age usually between 25 and 40 years at which a vehicle can be defined as antique and such cars are given special exemptions for things like licensing insurance and seat belt rules.</p>

According to Merriam Webster the term vintage relates primarily to wine and is an altered form of the French word vendage meaning the grapes picked during a season One of its secondary definitions is a period of origin or manufacture eg a vintage 1960s Mercedes. Some enthusiasts think classic cars have timeless design technological or nostalgic value and embrace the idea of modern classics. Similarly a Vintage Car was built before 1930 and Post Vintage referred to cars from the 30s until the end of WWII however after this point it all becomes a bit hazy. The definition of vintage is trickier.</p>

<p>The Prince Motor Company Was A Japanese Automobile Manufacturer From 1952 Until Its Merger With Nissan In 1966 Prince B Electric Cars Motor Company Japan Cars A subset of what is considered classic cars are known as antique cars or vintage cars manufactured pre-World War II. As far as I know this is the only term that has legal meaning. The definition of classic car is actually quite similar to that of antique cars. Similarly a Vintage Car was built before 1930 and Post Vintage referred to cars from the 30s until the end of WWII however after this point it all becomes a bit hazy. Whether or not your car is considered an antique depends on who youre asking and what state you live in.</p>
