You want to take care of a single stage paint just like you want to take care of a clear coat finish except that in most cases youll find single stage paints more forgiving to work on and easier to create a deep wet look as compared to a clear coat finish. The final choice you will likely need to make is whether to choose a single stage or dual stage paint. Single stage went out of style along with cattle rustling haha.</p>

<p>Ask A Pro How To Polish Single Stage Paint Ask A Pro Blog Hi mjm813 Welcome to Meguiars Online. Two stage paint is super to single stage paint in almost all measures. The final choice you will likely need to make is whether to choose a single stage or dual stage paint. Single stage demands total panel redo if theres a significant error whereas two. For this reason oils can leach out of single-stage paint over time especially if the paint is poorly cared for.</p>
