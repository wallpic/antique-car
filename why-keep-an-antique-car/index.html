<p>A vehicle is an antique if it is over 30 years old. Better to consider the old-car habit from another perspective. Maybe they had their first date in that car or that is the car the family when on annual picnics or maybe it was the car to have when they were young but they couldnt afford it.</p>
<h3 id="one-of-the-reasons-people-love-antique-cars-is-that-for-them-it-brings-back-childhood-or-teenage-memories">One of the reasons people love antique cars is that for them it brings back childhood or teenage memories.</h3><p>These days though places like Instagram are better than any car posters I ever had on my wall and the internet in general has made loving older vehicles easier than ever. One of the main reasons why we continue to covet vintage cars is because interacting with them can make us feel young again whether its from behind the wheel of a ride from our youth or while turning wrenches on it. The cleaner you keep the car the longer itll last And not just the exterior. If you restore an old car with history behind it youll help keep its spirit going in the auto world. Mind the undercarriage and sitting space as well.</p>
