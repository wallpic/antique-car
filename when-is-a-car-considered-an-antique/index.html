<p>1931 Isotta Fraschini Type 8a 2 Door Sports Sports Coupe Antique Cars Coupe Most insurance companies consider your car an antique or classic if it is at least 15 or 20 years old or older depending on where you live garaged when not in use To find out your states definition of a classic car and how old it must be to be considered a classic or antique. Once they reach this age in those states cars can be classified an antique and in many cases for a fee can have a special license plate indicating its antique status. So age is an easy concept to grasp but what does good condition mean. I would use the world antique in the car world as something built in 1942 or older. Collectibles can be anything collectible.</p>
