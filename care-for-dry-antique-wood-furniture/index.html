Light burnishing as you dust is adequate or buff with a long-term silver cloth. Wipe down the furniture and allow it to dry. Once youre finished cleaning you can wipe down the furniture with a dry rag. Leather upholstery should be dusted regularly and wiped down with a slightly damp cloth.</p>

<p>Dresser Restoration Manhattan Nest Danish Teak Furniture Restored Dresser Refinishing Furniture If your house or apartment is especially dry in winter you should use a humidifier. However the frequency of waxing is purely based on how often you use the furniture and cleanwipe it. Regarding dust if it is allowed to remain on the surface of your antiques it can actually damage the finish of wood brass and other surfaces. Preserve whats left for the next century by using deep penetrating oil on the antique wood. Metal cleaners should not be used as they can harm the wood around the mounts.</p>
