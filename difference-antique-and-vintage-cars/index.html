<p>Pin On Transportation With A Difference A antique car is simply defined as being over 45 years old. Their requirements are quite simple enough that an object to be classified as an antique must be made 100 years before the date of purchase. Denoting something from the past of high quality especially something representing the best of its kind. A vintage car is a car that was produced between 1919 and 1930. Judged over a period of time to be of the highest quality and outstanding of its kind.</p>

<p>Why Can T We Make Cars That Look Like This Retro Cars Classic Cars Vintage Photos Is there a difference between classic antique and vintage cars. The term vintage is generally used for cars that were manufactured between 1919 to 1931. Whats somewhat odd about this is that the first Ford Model T rolled off the production line in 1908 but wouldnt quantify as an antique if you follow this certain standard. An antique car is any car manufactured in 1975 or earlier older than 45 years old. Usually the classic car moniker applies to vehicles over 20 years old.</p>

Buyers in the know understand that an antique is something quite specific and not just anything old A seller who calls something made in the 1950s antique for example is just plain wrongA seller who uses the term antique when an item is much too new for that designation should raise questions in your mind. If it is a collector item is purely for show and will only be driven to events or a mechanic then it can be registered as an antique. Whats somewhat odd about this is that the first Ford Model T rolled off the production line in 1908 but wouldnt quantify as an antique if you follow this certain standard. Usually to have the title of a classic car the vehicle will need to be at least 20 years old.</p>
