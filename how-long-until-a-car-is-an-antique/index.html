Hi I am currently checking on a car for purchase. Once a cars age is over 40 it moves into the antique category. The Classic Car Club of America aka the CCCA is full of people who live and breathe classic and antique cars.</p>

<p>1936 Lagonda Lg 45 S3 Le Mans Style For Sale Car And Classic Classic Cars Vintage Vintage Cars Amazing Cars Whether or not your car is considered an antique depends on who youre asking and what state you live in. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. The definition of classic car is actually quite similar to that of antique cars. In the UK 25 years and over are classed as classic cars and over 40 years vintage. If however you ask HMRC for a definition then its anything thats at least 15 years old and worth a minimum of 15000.</p>
