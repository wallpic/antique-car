Some enthusiasts think classic cars have timeless design technological or nostalgic value and embrace the idea of modern classics. Those who are reputable antique dealers say the 50 years definition lowers the standard to a point that dealers can sell collectibles under the name of antiques.

Those who are reputable antique dealers say the 50 years definition lowers the standard to a point that dealers can sell collectibles under the name of antiques. A car must be at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old to be considered a classic car. A vintage car is an old car generally made between the years 1920 and 1930. States may also have their own rules to define.</p>
