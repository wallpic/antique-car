<p>1904 White Type E Antique Cars Classic Cars Vintage Cars The ride is a quarter mile in length and lasts approximately three minutes. The antique cars are on their way back to Kings Island. IMO Antique Cars are one of those rides that EVERY good park should have. Kings Island held a press conference today to make a very special throwback announcement. Stunt Track now known as the Backlot Stunt Coaster The Antique Cars were an original Kings Island attraction and operated in that space from 1972-2004.</p>
