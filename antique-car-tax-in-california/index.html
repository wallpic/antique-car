So even if you buy a 25 year old vehicle from another state California requires the vehicle meet EPA requirements for the year of the vehicle and a smog test prior to registration. Unfortunately if you live close to a state with a lower or no car sales tax such as if you live near Delaware you cannot buy a car in that state to avoid sales tax.</p>

<p>Legal Guide On Owning Classic Or Custom Cars In California Wctl According to the Sales Tax Handbook the California sales tax for vehicles is 75 percent. The display is currently all about the Bugatti but there are other antique vintage and classic vehicles on display so call for more information. According to California DMV if the vehicle was manufactured after 1922 and is at least 25 years old it is a Historical Vehicle. Local governments such as districts and cities can collect additional taxes on the sale of vehicles up to 25 in addition to the state tax. However if you bought it for 14000 and sold it for 15000 earning a 1000 capital gain you would report this on your tax return using Schedule D on Form 1040 thats appropriately titled Capital Gains and Losses.</p>

<p>Pin On Cars Machines California requires a title but doesnt require a safety inspection when it comes to classic cars. Some items are exempt from sales and use tax including. Written into the act is a provision for vehicles over 25 years of age reinforcing that cars over 25 years of age are classics and antiques. The 25-year rule represented a compromise. Retail sales of tangible items in California are generally subject to sales tax.</p>

Sales tax on a vintage car is a flat 125 fee plus 25 in a one-time tax regardless of how much you paid for the car. CA SalesUse tax varies by county and city and is anywhere from 725 to 975 this because the rate you pay include taxes imposed by various state local and county jurisdictions.
