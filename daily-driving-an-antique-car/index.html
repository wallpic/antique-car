When you take your first drive in a vintage car its almost impossible to not notice your new admirers. I like the styling of the pre59s but they are quite expensive. From 1990-92 I drove a 69 Dart GT and when it got wrecked I bought a 68 Dart 270 to replace it with. Thats easy enough nowadays its the import type cars that most kids drive.</p>

<p>Strutting Crow On Instagram Daily Driver Benz Rallye Mercedes Vintage Racer Car Auto Vintag Mercedes Benz Cars Mercedes Benz 300 Mercedes Benz 220 The original pony car doesnt have the power of its younger siblings but its a sporty fun drive. Same cops see it all the time most of them dont seem to quailfy themselves as. Outside of having a requirement that you must have a daily driver to get antique plates Maine is pretty light on antique plate restrictions but it does require a safety inspection of all vehicles. Of course were not suggesting that all classic cars are suitable for the cut and thrust of modern traffic but we think that this selection would cut the mustard day-in day-out. Heres one in good condition with less than 40000 miles on it you can bid on right now.</p>
