<p>Mg Sports Car 1954 Classic Cars British Classy Cars Old Classic Cars Synthetic is the ONLY thing to use. In general synthetic motor oil offers owners of newer cars trucks and SUVs multiple benefits from extending component life to reducing cost of routine maintenanceIf you have heard about the benefits of synthetic motor oil in vehicles you may be inclined to switch. To me the key is keeping an eye on the vitals routinely in what is now a vintage car - ie. Dynolite is a French-based oil specialist who says it was the lack of suitable oils that made it create a specific range of oils and lubes catering for vehicles made before 1914.

The idea that synthetic oil could harm old engines probably comes. HD diesel oils contain almost twice as much ZDDP zinc anti-wear as do modern PCMOS passenger car motor oils.</p>

<p>1927 Bentley 3 Litre 3 8 Vintage Car For Sale Can you use synthetic oil in old cars. Synthetic is the ONLY thing to use. Because classic cars are older their maintenance schedules are different from other vehicles and require more frequent oil changes. You dont have to do anything special to your engine first and the synthetic oil isnt going to cause problems in your vehicle that werent already there. On top of that many oil-change outlets also offer synthetic oil as an alternative to conventional engine oil.</p>
