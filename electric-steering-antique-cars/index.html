<h3 id="the-kit-is-designed-in-netherlands-by-engineering-company-ez-electric-power-steering-and-is-manufactured-in-japan-by-koyo-and-nsk">The kit is designed in Netherlands by engineering company EZ Electric Power Steering and is manufactured in Japan by Koyo and NSK.</h3><p>Several years ago American Powertrain developed an electric power steering system for sports cars including Ferraris Jaguars and Porsches. For earlier cars the slave cylinder setup is also relatively easy to adapt although it can be a little more complicated to mount the cylinder and brackets correctly so that it doesnt bind. Of course a serious problem arose. FORD has been using it as well. It can be installed in our workshop or on your own some skill and tools required.</p>
