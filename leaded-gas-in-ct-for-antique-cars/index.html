<p>Pin By Sara Foster On Keough Contemporary Interior Interior Design Pictures Home If your car is not suitable for ULP or PULP a fuel with a suitable octane rating and a lead replacement additive is needed. Many of the cars built even when leaded fuel was common have sufficiently hard valve seats to endure unleaded fuel use especially if the car was made after the mid-1960s. The lead in gasoline prevented engine knock in older cars and lead buildup on the valve seats effectively created a cushion onto which the valves closed. When lead was added to fuel in the past it did three things. Answer 1 of 3.</p>

<p>C 1930 Dordogne France 149 710 Old House Dreams Victorian Homes Exterior Old House Dreams Dordogne Lead replacement additives are available from service stations and auto parts suppliers. Any help with preventing valve seat recession was purely an unexpected side effect. The UK leaded petrol market currently accounts for about 37 per cent of total petrol sales a percentage which is falling each year as new cars designed to run on unleaded enter the market. Find out what fuel older cars can run on how to find inexpensive petrol near you plus more. To answer that question.</p>

By the turn of the century less than 10 per cent of all cars in Britain will need leaded petrol and it may not be as widely available as it is today. A cars octane requirement will be shown in its owners manual. It has been the rule since 1975 when automakers made the fuel filler neck smaller so the wider nozzle of leaded gas pumps could not fit in. Lead replacement additives are available from service stations and auto parts suppliers.</p>

<p>H30 31 Pict Carburetor Paruzzi Number 2141 113129027h What Did Leaded Petrol do for vintage cars. A cars octane requirement will be shown in its owners manual. If the fuel mixture went lean too much air and not enough fuel the computer would allow additional fuel to be added to the engine. Answer 1 of 3. You could reduce the engine compression to run it on regular pump gas.</p>
