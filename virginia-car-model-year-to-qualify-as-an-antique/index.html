<p>The Car And Carriage Caravan Museum Luray Virginia Luray Luray Virginia Shenandoah National Park As we mentioned above the Antique Auto Club of America says antique cars are those that are 25 years old or older. States may also have their own rules. Thats actually not that old when you think about it. Some states though allow cars to be classified as antique or classic in just 20 years while others require it to be older. Generally cars that are considered Vintage were manufactured between the years of 1919 and 1930 but some end it at 1925.</p>

On receipt of an application and evidence that the applicant owns or has regular use of another passenger car autocycle or motorcycle the Commissioner may authorize for use on antique motor vehicles and antique trailers Virginia license plates manufactured prior to 1976 and designed for use without decals if such license plates are embossed with or are of the same year of issue as the model year of the antique motor vehicle or antique. If youre considering getting antique plates for your classic car you car needs to be at least 25 30 years old. To make the issue more confusing there are also those who consider the phrases classic car and antique car to be synonymous while others use the term antique to describe a car that is at least 20 or 25 years old and classic for cars that have reached 50 years of age. Depending on how you plan to use your vehicle you may choose antique vintage or any one of our standard license plates.</p>
