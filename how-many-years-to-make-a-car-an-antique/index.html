The actual value of a vehicle can be easy or difficult to determine based on the age make and model of the vehicle. Antique cars are over 45 years old and vintage cars are built between 1919 and 1930. Classic is more vague. To make things even more complicated theres a third classification.</p>

<p>New Cars Used Cars For Sale Car Reviews And Car News Vintage Cars Cars Cycle Car The dictionary describes an antique as a piece of furniture tableware or the like made at a much earlier period than the present It is commonplace to recognize an antique as over 100 years but this timescale is sometimes disputed by experts with items aged between 50 and 80 years often being classified as antique. However many people define classic cars as those that are between 20 and 40 years old. To make the issue more confusing there are also those who consider the phrases classic car and antique car to be synonymous while others use the term antique to describe a car that is at least 20 or 25 years old and classic for cars that have reached 50 years of age. Those who are reputable antique dealers say the 50 years definition lowers the standard to a point that dealers can sell collectibles under the name of antiques. The vehicle should be roadworthy the body should have no rust the interior should be intact without tears in the upholstery flooring or header fabric and the engine should run.</p>

Since 1954 all vehicles made in the United States are assigned a vehicle identification number VIN. You can use the same standard to call it vintage which means about the same thing. Usually the magic number for cars to reach this designation is 25 years. Collector item vehicles will meet the state definition if they are older than 30 years whereas vehicles older than 40 years.</p>
