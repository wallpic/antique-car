Overall I find this state to be lenient on vintage car ownership We searched high and low on the DMVs website and couldnt find any exemption for titles regardless of year. 1 Antique vehicle means a passenger car or truck that is at least 25 years old. However vehicles registered for Antique Plates are exempted from state auto safety. Show TEXAS as big as passenger vehicles.</p>
