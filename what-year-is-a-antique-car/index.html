<p>Pick Of The Day 1930 Marmon Model 79 Sport Phaeton Ready To Tour Chrysler Antique Cars Amazing Cars As we mentioned above the Antique Auto Club of America says antique cars are those that are 25 years old or older. However what constitutes a classic car from an insurance perspective can vary between providers. In addition this vehicle may be a private passenger car a truck with a gross weight of less than 14000 pounds or a motorcycle. Our American cousins define vintage cars as being vehicles produced between 1919 and 1930. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car.</p>
