On a 6V coil you should read between 143 and 158 ohms resistance. The terminals of the coil are going to be marked negative and positive and these are the two points where the resistance of primary winding can be measured. Check the ignition coil secondary coil resistance by connecting an ohmmeter between the coil output terminal and the ignition coil negative terminal. To test this use an inline spark tester between the spark plug and coil.</p>

<p>In This Video I Show You Exactly How You Can Quickly Determine Whether You Have A Bad Ignition Coil Pack Or Not A Automotive Repair Car Repair Diy Car Mechanic Most coils should read between 04 and 2 ohms. The terminals of the coil are going to be marked negative and positive and these are the two points where the resistance of primary winding can be measured. You may use a strand of copper wire to use with the test light that connects to the negative terminal and sticks out from under the connector so that you have the connector plugged in to the ignition coil during the test. Turn on ignition dont start car then connect a voltmeter between the or SW terminal of the coil and ground. You can use the tester on any small engine mower snow blower chain saw string trimmer etc.</p>
