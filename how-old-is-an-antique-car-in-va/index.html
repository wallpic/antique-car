<p>Pin By Rodney Penny On British Classic Cars Futuristic Cars British Sports Cars Vintage Cars For a vehicle to be defined as antique it must be 25 years old or older. Usually the classic car moniker applies to vehicles over 20 years old. Under the current VA antique license plates rules vehicles with an antique car age of 26 years or more can be registered as historic vehicles. The definition of classic car is actually quite similar to that of antique cars. Antique cars are over 45 years old and vintage cars are built between 1919 and 1930.</p>
