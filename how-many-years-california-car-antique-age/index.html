So does that make everything built pre-1973 officially classic and everything built after not and never to be deemed so. This is How to Register a Custom or Antique Vehicle in California. To make the issue more confusing there are also those who consider the phrases classic car and antique car to be synonymous while others use the term antique to describe a car that is at least 20 or 25 years old and classic for cars that have reached 50 years of age.</p>

<p>Pin By Jose Carlos Eugenio On Vintage Rods California Parks Touring Car In most circumstances the vehicle needs to be over 25 years of age although this can vary by insurance carrier. A car must be at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old to be considered a classic car. The definition of classic car is actually quite similar to that of antique cars. One of the basic guidelines that many states use is the cars age. There are those who believe that a car becomes an antique at 15 20 or 25 years.</p>

<p>Pin On Construction When this was first introduced a car needs to be more than 25 years old to be eligible. The 25-year rule represented a compromise. I hope this essay has made clear to the reader why the exemption for collectable vehicles per California vehicle code 4604d3 is fair and just. Once a vehicle like this is 25 years old it is an antique in State Farms eyes and is no longer eligible for classic car insurance. Its partially a matter of passion.</p>

To qualify for classic car insurance coverage your vintage vehicle cannot be your everyday car and cannot be driven more than 8000 kilometers per year. An antique car is an automobile that is an antique. And critically if you have owned the car outside California for a long time the state assumes that the car has already depreciated from the initial purchase price out of state and that the car isnt worth much by the time you brought it to Calfornia. However some states consider anything made after the end of the Forties a Classic and anything from 1949 back to be an Antique.</p>
